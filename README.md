# Analyzing-Los-Angeles-Law-Enforcement-Stop-Data

# Overview

For this project I examine Los Angeles’s Vehicle and Pedestrian Stop Data to better understand policing trends. The data holds valuable information, such as date/time, general location, and race of individuals stopped by police. Dating back to 2010 till present, releasing the dataset was an initiative by the city to promote more transparency between law enforcement agencies and the public. 

The purpose of this project is to analyze a specific region of LA (Topanga) to better understand the trends and identify potentially problematic policing habits. 

Key Findings from this project:

•	Men are pulled over by police more frequently than women

•	Police stops are heightened at night and see their lowest numbers early in the morning

•	2/3 of Police stops are for individuals in vehicles and vehicle pull overs are more likely to result in further action taken by law enforcement

•	The results indicate Blacks & Hispanics have a higher likelihood of law enforcement engaging in post stop activity versus White counterparts. Conversely, Asians are less likely to have a police officer take further action after a stop compared to White counterparts.
